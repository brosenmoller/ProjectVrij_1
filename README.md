## Git rules

1. Always pull before pushing new changes
2. Always push to the "develop" branch, never to main
3. When editing a scene: 
   - Create a duplicate of the scene then overwrite the original scene with a pull.
   - Implement the changes from your duplicate scene into the original scene. 
   - Delete the copy and push your changes.
