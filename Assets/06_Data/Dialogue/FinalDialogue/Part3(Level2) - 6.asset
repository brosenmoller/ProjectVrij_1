  - "I just heard the generator is becoming really unstable. It\u2019s absolutely
    essential that you find a way to fix it. Otherwise this entire base might blow
    up. This base holds prisoners of war and essential resources for the war effort.
    If those are gone it will result in a diplomatic and military disaster. We cannot
    let that happen."
